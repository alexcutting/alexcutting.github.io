			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			<p>I am currently a student in a Modern Application Development Certificate Program ran through the University of Central Missouri.</p>
            <p>Inspiring others is a passion of mine and I would love to put my skills to the test!</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Born and raised in Kansas City, MO, this is all I have known. It is in my blood to be a Royals &amp; Chiefs fan, as well as a BBQ fan. I graduated from Winnetonka High School in Kansas City in 2014 and then pursued a career in Mareting at Missouri State University. After 2 years of schooling at MSU, I transfered back home to Maple Woods Community College for a semester. I dropped out the following semester due to falling grades and external family issues.</p>
            <p>I have learned much since dropping out of college and plan on pursuing a career in Coding through this program.</p>
